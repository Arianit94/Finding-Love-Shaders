# Finding Love Shaders
This repository demonstrates shaders from 3 prominent elements of the [Finding Love](https://findinglove.activetheory.net) experience.

The demo code uses latest ES6 features without transpilation, so Chrome is recommended.

To view, [create a local environment if necessary](https://threejs.org/docs/#Manual/Getting_Started/How_to_run_things_locally), and point your browser to:

`http://localhost/#Gem`

`http://localhost/#Sky`

`http://localhost/#Terrain`

You'll be able to adjust shader uniforms directly in browser and the shaders themselves are in the `shaders/` folder.
